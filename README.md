# TrainClimbing.com

### Description:

This web application is built by climbers, for climbers. 🧗‍♂️ Our platform exists to help boulder bros, grade pushers, and crushers everywhere get stronger 💪 and train smarter 🧠. Users create personal accounts, choose from 1 of 2 training plans, and log their daily progress towards personalized goals.

We've all experienced the frustration of hitting a plateau 😔. Usually, this is because we climb without a plan. With [trainclimbing.com](https://trainclimbing.com), now you have one.
