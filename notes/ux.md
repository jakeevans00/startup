## User Experience

Design as a story. Think about what brings someone to your page, what they hope to experience there. Make sure that you balance familiarity with innovation. Make it intuitive but fresh.

Key Principles:

1. Simplicity: attracts user's attention, engages them, without overwhelming them. Reinforce purpose of application
2. Consistency: Be consistent with how other apps function!
